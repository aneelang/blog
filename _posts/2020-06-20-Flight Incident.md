### Flight from Chennai to Delhi

I have travelled between India and Canada quite some times, to have actually gotten bored to travel anymore. Don't get me wrong - travelling is always fun, and I look forward to it, but spending 24 - 30 hours on a one-way trip isn't really comforting, trust me - I have done it quite a few times in the last two years to make this remark. What comes after the travel is fun, but travelling back  is just frustrating.

Anyways, travelling has brought across numerous interesting conversations and characters in my life and my last flight was no different, except this time I was suffering a high fever, carrying tablets of Dolo - 650 to be taken after dinner at the Delhi airport. I always ask for the aisle seat in a flight because of my height and I'm claustrophobic. I got myself an aisle seat, stretched, prepared myself for a 28 hour travel with a book on my hand. A family of four, two young boys - six and one year old boarded. The family was given split seats - two of the seats were beside me and another seat across the row. I was asked if I could exchange seats, to which I would have said yes, given any other day, but I didn't.

Nevertheless, they didn't take it lightly and tried to shift seats with others on the flight and everyone else neglected. Somehow, another person sitting behind his family topped me being sick, and for the beginning of the flight I experienced fifteen minutes of extreme rash language - from a kid who went on to say he doesn't want to sit next to a stranger - to the mother complaning - "there isn't business class in this flight" - and numerous other negative talk. Funny enough, nothing gave me the thought to move because I've encountered worst forms of claustrophobia to know words aren't going to move me from that seat.

> I did give away my seat, and that travel to Canada became one of the worst travel's I've encountered when travelling alone.

The baby started to cry, which is when I realized this is how the travel is going to go unless I actually give up the seat and work on handling my health issues. I gave up the seat to the father and the flight thankfully landed in 45 minutes and my travel continued.

> Tbh, Delhi has the longest airport, especially on an empty stomach, suffering from a high-fever, carrying hand luggage and a heavy backpack -> if you can skip that travel, just stay home!
