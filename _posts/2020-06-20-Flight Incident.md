### Flight from Chennai to Delhi

I have travelled between India and Canada quite some times, to have actually gotten bored of continue travelling anymore. Don't get me wrong - travelling is always fun, and I look forward to it, but spending 24 - 30 hours on a one-way trip isn't really comforting, trust me - I have done it thrice in the last two years. What comes after the travel is fun, but travelling back to the country where you have shifted to is a completely different scenario.

Anyways, travelling has brought across numerous interesting conversations and characters in my life and my last flight was no different, except this time I was suffering a high fever, carrying tablets of Dolo - 650 to be taken after dinner at the Delhi airport. I always ask for the aisle seat in a flight because of my height and I'm claustrophobic. I got myself an aisle seat, stretched, prepared myself for a 28 hour travel with my book on my hand. A family of four, two young boys - six and one year old. The family was given split seats - two of the seats were beside me and another seat across the row. I was asked if I could exchange seats, to which I would have said yes, given any other day, but I couldn't that day.
